Hello! This is a telegram bot

python3 pip3

Add necessary libraries

Create a bot in a BotFather with a /newbot command and get token

This bot is sending message("Hello, today our training is in 'somewhere' starts at 'some time'. 

Who is going to come please text '+' and '-' who will not come") on monday, wednesday and friday at 11.00 AM

Some users(like coach) can set and change the place, time and week day. And turn it off if the training is cancelled.

Each time a person texts '+' it counts number of players and replies "n players is going to come today"

If someone puts two or more '++' it counts as well

If the user who has put '+' changed his mind and text '-' it minuses the number of players and sends "'User name' changed his mind 'n' players is going to come today".

If user texts 'I don't know yet' bot sends message("So, are you going to come today? Please text '+' or '-' in our group 'group link'") to him privately in 4 hours
